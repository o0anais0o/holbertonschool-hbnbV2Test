  <span style="color:white;"><strong>HBnB Project – Business Logic and API Endpoints</strong></span>

---

## 🗺️ Overview
This project constitutes the second phase of the HBnB application. The main objective is to implement the business logic layer and API endpoints, leveraging the Python Flask framework and the flask-restx extension. This phase focuses on structuring the project, creating the main entities, implementing RESTful endpoints, and managing interactions between the different layers, while respecting best practices for modularity and software architecture.

## ℹ️ About
This project is being developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. It aims to apply the principles of software design, modular architecture, and modern RESTful API development.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Structure the project according to a modular architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence).
- Implement the main classes: User, Place, Review, Amenity, and their relationships.
- Set up RESTful endpoints to manage CRUD operations (excluding deletion in this section) on entities.
- Use the Facade pattern to simplify communication between layers.
- Document and test the API.
- Prepare the code for future integration of JWT authentication and access control (not included in this section).

## ✨ Key Features
- **User Management** : Creation, retrieval (list and by ID), update (without deletion). Passwords are never returned in API responses.
- **Place Management** : Creation, retrieval, update. Management of relationships with owners (users) and amenities.
- **Amenities Management** : Creation, retrieval, update.
- **Review Management** : Creation, retrieval, update (planned implementation).
- **Advanced Serialization** : API responses include extended attributes of related objects (e.g., owner information in a place).
- **Validation and Integrity** : Attribute verification (e.g., price, latitude, longitude for places), relationship management, and data consistency.
- **Testing** : Use of Postman or cURL to validate endpoints.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Flask
- Flask-Restx
- Modular Architecture (Separated Layers)
- Facade Pattern
- In-Memory Repository (planned for SQL Alchemy later)

## 🚀 Launching the project
1. Clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/holbertonschool-hbnb.git
cd holbertonschool-hbnb/part2
```

2. Install dependencies :
```
pip install -r requirements
```

3. Launch the application :
```
run.py
```

4. Access the interactive API documentation (generated by flask-restx) at :
```
http://localhost:5000/
```
